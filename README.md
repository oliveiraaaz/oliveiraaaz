About Me

I am a Cybersecurity and Information Security student, currently working as a Junior Helpdesk Technician at a telecommunications company, where I deal daily with real-world infrastructure issues, networking, support, and baseline security.
I hold certifications such as CEH, ISC2 CC, Cisco Endpoint Security, and CyberSecurity Essentials, along with hands-on experience in SOC environments and digital investigation practices.
I enjoy combining strategic thinking with technical execution — understanding how attacks work to build truly effective defenses.

🎯 Current focus: Red Team operations, offensive techniques, Digital Forensics, and artifact analysis

🛠️ Tools & languages: Python 🐍, Linux 🐧, SIEM, automation workflows, Packet Tracer 🌐

📡 Practical experience: technical support, fault diagnostics, network troubleshooting, corporate environments, and telecom operations

📭 Talk to me about: cybersecurity careers, certifications, offensive security, forensics, and realistic paths to grow in the field

💬 Questions that drive me: “How can this be exploited?”, “What traces does this leave behind?”, “How can we take this defense to the next level?”

👾 Fun fact: I’m fascinated by how legitimate tools and technologies can be used in unexpected ways — helping me anticipate scenarios, strengthen defenses, and think like an attacker while staying within ethical boundaries.

🚀 Personal vision: to transform security operations into something more intelligent, proactive, and human, using technique and imagination to build truly resilient environments
